# entries

Gets the strongly-typed entries of the wrapped object.

<Callout type="info">
  This is identical to `Object.entries(){:ts}`, but with entries typed more narrowly than
   `[string, any][]{:ts}`
</Callout>

```ts copy
import { obj } from "@tsly/obj";

const person = {
  firstName: "Jane",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 21,
};

const entries = obj(person).entries;
//    ^? (["firstName", readonly "Jane"] | ["lastName", readonly "Doe"] | ["age", number])[]

console.log(entries); // [["firstName", "Jane"], ["lastName", "Doe"], ["age", 21]]
```

<OpenPlayground

import { obj } from "@tsly/obj";

  firstName: "Jane",
  lastName: "Doe",
